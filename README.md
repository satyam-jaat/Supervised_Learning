# 15 Supervised Learning Projects

This repository contains 15 Supervised Learning Projects from basic to intermediate level, these projects are divided into two groups **Regression** and **Classification** named as Regression_Projects having the regression based projects and another is Classification_Projects having the classification projects ranging from basic to intermediate. 

## Projects Overview

### Regression Projects
These projects focus on supervised learning tasks where the goal is to predict a continuous value. Some key concepts include linear regression, decision trees, and support vector regression.

1. **Boston Housing Price Prediction**  
   - Implement a basic linear regression model to predict house prices based on features like size, location, etc.

2. **Student Score Prediction**  
   - Predict student scores based on factors such as study time, hours spent studying, and other relevant features.

3. **Car Price Prediction**  
   - Use regression models to predict the price of cars based on various features like make, model, year, and mileage.

4. **Medical Insurance Cost Prediction**  
   - Predict the medical insurance costs of individuals based on various personal and health-related factors.

5. **Concrete Strength Prediction**  
   - Build a regression model to predict the strength of concrete based on its mix composition.

6. **Bike Sharing Demand Prediction**  
   - Predict bike sharing demand for a specific city based on weather and temporal features.

7. **Airbnb Rental Price Prediction**  
   - Predict the rental price of Airbnb properties based on various features such as location, size, and amenities.

### Classification Projects
These projects focus on tasks where the goal is to categorize data into predefined classes. You'll explore algorithms like logistic regression, decision trees, and k-nearest neighbors for classification problems.

1. **Flower Classification**  
   - Classify different species of flowers based on their physical characteristics (e.g., petal length, sepal width, etc.).

2. **Titanic Survival Prediction**  
   - Predict whether a passenger survived or not on the Titanic based on features such as age, gender, and passenger class.

3. **Breast Cancer Detection**  
=   - Build a classification model to detect whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on various features of cell nuclei.

4. **Spam Email Detection**  
   - Classify emails as spam or not spam based on their content using natural language processing techniques.

5. **Heart Disease Prediction**  
   - Predict whether a person is likely to have heart disease based on factors such as cholesterol levels, age, and exercise habits.

6. **Customer Churn Prediction**  
   - Predict whether a customer will churn or stay based on customer behavior data and demographic features.

7. **Credit Card Fraud Detection**  
   - Build a model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using transaction history and other relevant features.

8. **Mushroom Edibility Classification**  
   - Classify whether a mushroom is edible or poisonous based on its attributes (e.g., color, size, habitat, etc.).
