# Car Price Prediction

This project is a regression-based project in which various features of a car such as its age, mileage, brand, fuel type, and transmission (inputs) are used to predict the car's selling price (target value). The model uses supervised learning techniques to understand the relationship between these features and the market value of the car, enabling it to make accurate price predictions.
