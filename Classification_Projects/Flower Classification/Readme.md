# Flower Classification


This project is a classification-based machine learning project in which flower features such as petal and sepal length and width (input) are used to predict the species of the flower (target class). The model uses supervised learning techniques to learn the patterns and differences among flower types and classify them accurately into categories like Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica.
